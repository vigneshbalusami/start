I am going to discuss about my native place "NAMAKKAL". "NAMAKKAL" is one of a famous cities in tamilnadu and it 
especially for educations, lorrys and eggs production including farming is one of a main things in our life.
let we see in detail.

Namakkal is a nice place to lives and  have  less polution then it  also consist of good transport facilities. The egg productions
 and lorry transports are lucrative business in my native and also mostly cultivates "Tapioca" plants. The famous anjaneyar
 temple has been palced in centre of namakkal and the india's second largest sugar mill are also located here. The major support 
for agriculture is "KAVERI" river is passed accross through namakkal.One of a famous turioust place "KOLLI" hills are located in 
namakkal as like lots of precious things are located here.

These are all precious gift which given by nature, so we must save all the things. we should reduce the polutions by
 plating trees and to save our environment. Then we should maintain lakes and ponds to avoid water scarcity at summer.
Thanking you.
